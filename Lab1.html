<p><b>WELCOME!</b> I am Chi Nou Yang or you can call me Chi.
			I am 22 year old and just graduated from Century College with my A.S degree in Computer Science.
			I am working toward my B.A degree in Computer Information Technology at Metro State University. I'm also a full 
			time student at Metro State. The courses that I'm taking this semester are Computer & Operating Systems Fundamentals 1 and 2, 
			Computer Security, and Web Design and Implementation. I love technology but
			but they don't love me. My favorite color are blue and white. I have 3 brothers and 3 sister. There is no particular pets that
			I like but if I were to be put in a life or death situation, I would go with a parrot!
			I would like to visit Japan and Mexico someday. I enjoy doing outdoor activities. 
			One thing I would like to try some day is go sky diving!</p>
